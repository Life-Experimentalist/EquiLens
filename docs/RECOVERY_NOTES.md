# üîÑ EquiLens Recovery Log

**Date**: October 15, 2025
**Status**: ‚úÖ Successfully Recovered

## Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Verification Script Path Bug
**Problem**: `verify_setup.py` was using incorrect project root path
- Used `Path(__file__).parent` which pointed to `scripts/setup/`
- Should have been `Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent` for project root

**Fix Applied**: Updated both `check_directory_structure()` and `check_configuration_files()` functions

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/setup/verify_setup.py` (lines 92, 119)

### 2. ‚úÖ Missing Python Package
**Problem**: `textual` package not installed

**Fix Applied**:
```powershell
uv add textual
```

**Result**: Installed textual 6.2.1 and dependencies

### 3. ‚úÖ Results Directory
**Problem**: `results/` directory didn't exist

**Fix Applied**: Directory was automatically created during UV sync

## Current System Status

### ‚úÖ Working
- Python 3.13.3
- All dependencies installed
- Complete project structure
- Configuration files verified
- Docker available (28.4.0)
- NVIDIA GPU detected
- System resources adequate (31.7 GB RAM)

### ‚è≥ Pending
- Docker Desktop needs to be started
- Ollama service needs to be launched
- AI models need to be downloaded

---

## Recovery Commands Used

```powershell
# Fixed verification script paths
# (Manual edit via replace_string_in_file)

# Installed missing package
uv add textual

# Verified setup
uv run scripts/setup/verify_setup.py
```

---

## Next Actions Required

1. **Start Docker Desktop**
   - Launch from Windows Start Menu
   - Wait for initialization

2. **Start Ollama**
   ```powershell
   docker-compose up -d ollama
   ```

3. **Download Models**
   ```powershell
   docker-compose exec ollama ollama pull phi3
   ```

4. **Final Verification**
   ```powershell
   uv run scripts/setup/verify_setup.py
   ```
   Should show 8/8 passes

---

## Files Recovered

All files were already present from GitHub clone:
- ‚úÖ Source code (`src/`)
- ‚úÖ Documentation (`docs/`)
- ‚úÖ Configuration files (`pyproject.toml`, `docker-compose.yml`, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Scripts (`scripts/`)
- ‚úÖ Tests (`tests/`)
- ‚úÖ Public assets (`public/`)

**No files were lost** - only needed dependency installation and path fixes.

---

## Lessons Learned

1. Always use absolute path resolution in verification scripts
2. `Path(__file__)` needs careful handling in nested directory structures
3. UV package manager makes dependency recovery simple
4. Verification scripts are critical for quick diagnosis
